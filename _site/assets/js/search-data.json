In fact, it’s central to almost all areas of mathematics. In this course, we will follow the idea of solving linear equations $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ and introduce the four fundamental subspaces for the matrix $A$.

Then we’ll explain the fundamental theorem of linear algebra. Also we’ll show some applications. By the end of the course, students will learn: . | The row and column picture of $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$, and hence the elimination in the beautiful form $A=LU$. | The concept of subspace and the four fundamental subspaces for the matrix $A$. | Determinants. | Eigenvalues and eigenvectors. | Linear transformations. | Singular value decomposition.(SVD) | Applications of linear algebra. | .

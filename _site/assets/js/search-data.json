    "content": "Turing Award awardee Knuth once said, “Computer Science is the study of algorithms”. Even though the speed of computers is now so fast that we might even question whether Moore’s Law still holds true, the significance of an efficient algorithm remains essential for us. Therefore, in this course, we aim to present various algorithms for numerous ‘standard’ algorithmic problems. We will illustrate both algorithm design techniques and the methods employed in algorithm analysis. By the end of the course, students will attain proficiency in applying fundamental algorithm design techniques and will become acquainted with the key theoretical instruments utilized in algorithm analysis. Moreover, since this course is designed for senior undergraduates, we will provide an introduction to notable subfields within algorithmic research, thereby offering potential directions for further study. Enjoy the class! . See the Syllabus page for more details on course policies. ",

Actually, you can also ask for the instructor. However, directly copying and pasting code or answers is prohibited. If I ask you how your code works or why your answers are correct and you do not know, it will be evident that you have copied it. Don’t take the risk. Homework . The HW, will be released once a week. The main content is the design of algorithms for certain problems and the corresponding algorithm analysis. Please submit the solution via the email qzyang@shnu.edu.cn. Please note that late submissions will incur a 25% penalty. Program Assignments . The PA will also be released once a week. We will use the problem on Leet Code. Please submit the solution via the email qzyang@shnu.edu.cn. Here is a sample submission sample. After each program assignment, the instructor will randomly select one student to present their solutions to the class. Please note that late submissions will incur a 25% penalty. Final Exam . This course will have only one exam, the final exam. The more information will be decided later. Bonus Points . TBA. Grades . Students’ gradesGrade will be determined by the following components: . | HomeworkHW, | Program AssignmentsPA , | Final ExamExam, | Bonus PointsBonus. | . The final grade will be calculated using the following equation: Grade = MIN{25%* HW + 15%* PA+ 60%* Exam +5%* Bonus ,100} . ",

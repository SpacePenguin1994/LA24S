    "content": "Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as: . | $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \\cdots + a_nx_n = b$, | . linear maps such as: . | $(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\rightarrow a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \\cdots + a_nx_n$ | . In fact, it’s central to almost all areas of mathematics. In this course, we will follow the idea of solving linear equations $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ and introduce the four fundamental subspaces for the matrix $A$. Hence we’ll show the fundamental theorem of linear algebra. Enjoy the class! . See the Syllabus page for more details on course policies. ",

The vector of $A\\mathbf{x}$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$. By solving the equations, We’ll introduce the four fundamental subspaces for the matrix $A$. Then we’ll explain the fundamental theorem of linear algebra. Also we’ll show some applications. By the end of the course, students will learn: . | The row and column picture of $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$, and hence the elimination in the beautiful form $A=LU$. | The concept of subspace and the four fundamental subspaces for the matrix $A$. | Determinants. | Eigenvalues and eigenvectors. | Linear transformations. | Singular value decomposition.(SVD) | Applications of linear algebra. | .

However, directly copying and pasting code or answers is prohibited. If I ask you how you proved or why your answers are correct and you do not know, it will be evident that you have copied it. Don’t take the risk. Homework . The HW will be released once a week. Please note that late submissions will incur a 25% penalty. Final Exam . This course will have only one exam, the final exam. The more information will be decided later. Grades . Students’ gradesGrade will be determined by the following two components: . | HomeworkHW, | Final ExamExam, | . The final grade will be calculated using the following equation: Grade = 40%* HW + 60%* Exam . ",

## About the Class

Turing Award awardee [Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) once said, "Computer Science is the study of algorithms". Even though the speed of computers is now so fast that we might even question whether Moore's Law still holds true, the significance of an efficient algorithm remains essential for us. 

Therefore, in this course, we aim to present various algorithms for numerous 'standard' algorithmic problems. We will illustrate both algorithm design techniques and the methods employed in algorithm analysis. By the end of the course, students will attain proficiency in applying fundamental algorithm design techniques and will become acquainted with the key theoretical instruments utilized in algorithm analysis. Moreover, since this course is designed for senior undergraduates, we will provide an introduction to notable subfields within algorithmic research, thereby offering potential directions for further study.

Enjoy the class!

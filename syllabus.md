## Overview

In this course, our aim is to explain this beautiful and useful part of mathematics. We' ll start with solving linear equations $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$. The vector of $A\mathbf{x}$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$. By solving the equations, We'll introduce the four fundamental subspaces for the matrix $A$. Then we'll explain the fundamental theorem of linear algebra. Also we'll show some applications.

By the end of the course, students will learn:
-  The row and column picture of $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$, and hence the elimination in the beautiful form $A=LU$.
-  The concept of subspace and the four fundamental subspaces for the matrix $A$. 
-  Determinants.
-  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
-  Linear transformations.
-  Singular value decomposition.(SVD)
-  Applications of linear algebra.


## Policies

### Cheating

You are encouraged to collaborate with your classmates or utilize online resources for any homework. Actually, you can also ask for the instructor. **However, directly copying and pasting code or answers is prohibited.** If I ask you how you proved or  why your answers are correct 
and you do not know, it will be evident that you have copied it. Don’t take the risk. 

### Homework

The **HW**{:.label.label-red} will be released once a week. 

**Please note that late submissions will incur a 25% penalty.**

### Final Exam

This course will have only one exam, the final exam. The more information will be decided later.

### Grades

Students' grades**Grade**{:.label.label-green} will be determined by the following  two components:
-  Homework**HW**{:.label.label-red},
-  Final Exam**Exam**{:.label.label-green},


The final grade will be calculated using the following equation:

: **Grade**{:.label.label-green} = 40%* **HW**{:.label.label-green} +  60%* **Exam**{:.label.label-green}

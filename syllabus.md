## Overview

In this course, our aim is to present various algorithms for numerous 'standard' algorithmic problems. We will illustrate both algorithm design techniques and the methods employed in algorithm analysis. Moreover, since this course is designed for senior undergraduates, we will provide an introduction to notable subfields within algorithmic research, thereby offering potential directions for further study.

By the end of the course, students will learn:
-  the application of fundamental algorithm design techniques.
-  the main theoretical tools used in the analysis of algorithms
-  the ability for desigining algorithms for some algorithmic problems.
-  the ability for analysing given algorithms.
-  an outline of the notable subfields within algorithmic research.


## Policies

### Cheating

You are encouraged to collaborate with your classmates or utilize online resources for any homework, program assignments, or bonus points. Actually, you can also ask for the instructor. **However, directly copying and pasting code or answers is prohibited.** If I ask you how your code works or why your answers are correct 
and you do not know, it will be evident that you have copied it. Don’t take the risk. 

### Homework

The **HW**{:.label.label-red}, will be released once a week. The main content is the design of algorithms for certain problems and the corresponding algorithm analysis. Please submit the solution via the email <qzyang@shnu.edu.cn>.

**Please note that late submissions will incur a 25% penalty.**


### Program Assignments

The **PA**{:.label.label-blue} will also be released once a week. We will use the problem on [Leet Code](https://leetcode.cn/).   Please submit the solution via the email <qzyang@shnu.edu.cn>. Here is a sample submission [sample](https://basics.sjtu.edu.cn/~yangqizhe/pdf/algo2023w/homework/sample.pdf).

After each program assignment, the instructor will randomly select one student to present their solutions to the class.

**Please note that late submissions will incur a 25% penalty.**

### Final Exam

This course will have only one exam, the final exam. The more information will be decided later.

### Bonus Points

TBA.

### Grades

Students' grades**Grade**{:.label.label-green} will be determined by the following components:
-  Homework**HW**{:.label.label-red},
-  Program Assignments**PA**{:.label.label-blue} ,
-  Final Exam**Exam**{:.label.label-green},
-  Bonus Points**Bonus**{:.label.label-green}.

The final grade will be calculated using the following equation:

: **Grade**{:.label.label-green} = MIN{25%* **HW**{:.label.label-red} + 15%* **PA**{:.label.label-blue}+ 60%* **Exam**{:.label.label-green} +5%* **Bonus**{:.label.label-green} ,100}


## Resources

This course website, [Algorithms](../), will be your one-stop resource for the syllabus, schedule and homework links. 


**LeetCode**

[Leet Code](https://leetcode.cn/) is an online platform that offers a wide array of coding challenges and problems, primarily focused on helping individuals improve their programming and problem-solving skills. We will use the website to complete our program assignments.
